# LAMP Stack by Moat Systems

LAMP enables you to quickly start building your websites and applications by providing a coding framework. As a developer, it provides standalone project directories to store your applications.

This image is configured for production environments. It includes SSL auto-configuration with Let's Encrypt certificates, and the latest releases of PHP, Apache, and MySQL on Linux. This application also includes phpMyAdmin, PHP main modules and Composer.

This open source solution is packaged by Moat Systems. Learn how to install, configure, and manage it. For deployment issues, reach out our support team [here](https://www.moatsystems.com/contact/).

Why use Moat Systems Certified Apps?

Moat Systems certified images are always up-to-date, secure, and built to work right out of the box.

Moat Systems packages applications following industry standards, and continuously monitors all components and libraries for vulnerabilities and application updates. When any security threat or update is identified, Moat Systems automatically repackages the applications and pushes the latest versions to the cloud marketplaces.

## Features

LAMP Stack by Moat Systems is pre-configured with the following technologies:

1. **Apache**: a fast and light-weight web server
2. **Certbot**: is EFF's tool to obtain certs from Let's Encrypt and (optionally) auto-enable HTTPS on your server.
3. **Ubuntu**: applies Kernel Self Protection measures, assures control flow integrity and adds stack-clash protection for systemic forward-looking enterprise security.
4. **PHP7**: drops many [deprecated functions](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.deprecated.php) in favor of [new, modernized features](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php). Additionally, [PHP 5.6](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) will stop receiving security updates on December 31, 2018.
5. **MySQL (MariaDB)**: is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) that is a compatible drop-in replacement for the widely used MySQL database technology.
6. **Composer**: helps you declare, manage, and install dependencies of PHP projects.
