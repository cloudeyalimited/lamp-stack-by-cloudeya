# LAMP Stack by Cloudeya

LAMP enables you to quickly start building your websites and applications by providing a coding framework. As a developer, it provides standalone project directories to store your applications.

This image is configured for production environments. It includes SSL auto-configuration with Let's Encrypt certificates, and the latest releases of PHP, Apache, and MySQL on Linux. This application also includes phpMyAdmin, PHP main modules and Composer.

This open source solution is packaged by Cloudeya. Learn how to install, configure, and manage it. For deployment issues, reach out our support team [here](mailto:tech@cloudeya.org).

Why use Cloudeya Certified Apps?

Cloudeya certified images are always up-to-date, secure, and built to work right out of the box.

Cloudeya packages applications following industry standards, and continuously monitors all components and libraries for vulnerabilities and application updates. When any security threat or update is identified, Cloudeya automatically repackages the applications and pushes the latest versions to the cloud marketplaces.

## Features

LAMP Stack by Cloudeya is pre-configured with the following technologies:

1. **Apache**: a fast and light-weight web server.
2. **Certbot**: is EFF's tool to obtain certs from Let's Encrypt and (optionally) auto-enable HTTPS on your server.
3. **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu**.
4. **PHP 8**: drops many [deprecated functions](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.deprecated.php) in favor of [new, modernized features](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.new-features.php). Additionally, [PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) will stop receiving security updates on November 28, 2022.
5. **MySQL (MariaDB)**: is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) that is a compatible drop-in replacement for the widely used MySQL database technology.
6. **Composer**: helps you declare, manage, and install dependencies of PHP projects.
